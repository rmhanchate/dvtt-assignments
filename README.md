# Digital VLSI Testing and Testability
ISCAS-85 Netlist is parsed and a dictionary is generated. The following tasks have been performed:
## Timing Models
Simulating circuit for various timing models specified:
 1. Transport delay
 2. Multiple delay
 3. Min-Max delay

## Fault Modelling and Simulation
 1. Forming a list of all faults.
 2. Obtaining collapsed faults using equivalence and dominant fault collapsing.
 3. Parallel and Deductive Fault Simulation.
 4. SCOAP Controllability and Observability.

## Roth's D-Algorithm
Test Vectors generated for a combinational circuit. Supports only two-input gates.
